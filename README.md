OB Platform notes:

## design / layout

- dark mode please please
- I think the learn should be separate page than the dashboard - the dashboard stuff is distracting when I'm trying to find something in the docs
  - the learn page links have some weird event handling on right clicks where it opens in the new tab and the current tab simultaneously

## vscode extension

- missing docs
- think a better UX would be to have things organized as a top nav instead of the vertical accordion menus, with Home, Workstations, Settings (with debug up in there). The Home tab should also have a link to the docs.
  - the Home tab when extended takes up most of the available real estate and is not all that useful in this context.. but in a top nav it could take up all the space it wants and not interfere with the rest of the content
  - think the OB workstations and workstation info should be combined, but again not as big of a deal in a nav situation as there's more room to work with
